# FaceRecognitionSample

## Overview:
Using face_recognition library in this project for the face recognition review.
my results was calculated using counting samples over live feed from my webcam

## results:
  - success rate : 1.0 for 100 samples
  - false alarms : 0 for 100 samples
 

â€¢ Do you think this can be used for road cones recognition?
> As said in the overview using the face_recognition library was followed by downloading opencd and dlib dependencies.
> From my review over face_recognition documentation I saw that most of the given function focused on face detection for manipulation and comparisons.
> I can tell that reading about dlib it possible to track objects from there, but I guess there are more library that can give more convenient ways to map the road cone structure.
